        <h2>The Long History of AstroKotlin</h2>
        <div class="history-content">
            <h3>How I Started</h3>
            My programming adventure began with PHP, but not in the traditional way most might expect. I was introduced to PHP through PocketMine-MP, an open-source server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition. This experience was a game-changer—quite literally! As a Minecraft enthusiast, the idea of customizing and extending the game through plugins written in PHP was both fascinating and empowering.
            <br><br>
            With PocketMine-MP, I learned how to manipulate game mechanics, create custom commands, and design plugins that added new features to the game. PHP became my gateway into the world of server-side programming, and I quickly became proficient in the language, mastering concepts like object-oriented programming, event handling, and database interaction. Working with PocketMine-MP taught me how to solve problems creatively and think like a programmer, setting the foundation for everything that came after.
            
            <h3>How I Approach Other Languages</h3>
            Building on my PHP experience, I expanded my skill set to include Python. Python's simplicity and versatility made it an ideal language for exploring new domains, from web development with Django and Flask to automation and data analysis. Python opened up a world of possibilities, allowing me to delve into areas like machine learning, scripting, and even artificial intelligence.
            <br><br>
            JavaScript was my next frontier, where I discovered the power of frontend development. With JavaScript, I could bring my web applications to life, creating dynamic, interactive user experiences. I quickly learned how to build responsive websites using modern frameworks like React and Vue, crafting user interfaces that were not only functional but also engaging and visually appealing.
            
            <h3>My Philosophy as a Programmer: Code with Purpose</h3>
            As a programmer, I believe that every line of code should serve a purpose. My journey from PocketMine-MP to mastering multiple programming languages has shaped my approach to coding—always focusing on creating clean, maintainable, and efficient solutions. I’m driven by a desire to build things that make a difference, whether it's a custom Minecraft plugin, a sleek web application, or a high-performance C++ program.
            <br><br>
            Collaboration, continuous learning, and a passion for problem-solving are at the core of my programming philosophy. I’m constantly exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with fellow developers. Whether working on a personal project or as part of a team, I always aim to deliver code that is both functional and elegant.
            
            <h3>How do I feel about being a programmer?</h3>
            Programming isn’t just a career for me—it’s a passion and a lifelong journey. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge, whether it’s learning a new programming language like Rust or diving into emerging fields like artificial intelligence and blockchain. I believe that the world of technology is ever-evolving, and as a programmer, it’s crucial to stay curious, adaptable, and open to new ideas.
